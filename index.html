    <h2><b> About the temple</b></h2>
    <p> Mekekattu Nandikeshwara Temple is a historic site located about 20 kilometers from Kundapura, nestled within Udupi taluk's boundaries in a secluded area near Saibra Katte. Not far from Barkur in Shirya village, this site is steeped in legend. Allegedly constructed by Parshurama, it shares architectural similarities with other major temples along the coastal region of Karnataka. Believed to be over 1000 years old, the temple draws significant crowds during the Sankranti festival, particularly for its annual events, Hasara and Sedi.

      Temple Facts:
      A remarkable aspect of the Mekekattu Nandikeshwara Temple is its extensive collection of colorful wooden idols, many standing up to 10 feet tall. These idols are crafted from Halsa Mara (Jackfruit tree wood), abundant in nearby forests. Primarily depicted in warrior attire, these statues seem to commemorate a historical battle, speculated to have occurred between 1600-1700 A.D. during either the Mogul or Bahamani invasions, although no concrete evidence supports this theory. The idols, vibrant and towering, are periodically restored; the last restoration occurred in 1970, followed by a repaint in 2007. Of the 365 temples originally surrounding Barkur, only five remain active, with the rest having succumbed to ruin. Some statues even replicate ancient weaponry, poised as if ready for combat, and each bears a local legendary name.
      
      Mythology & Folklore:
      The temple is associated with two main legends. The first involves sage Parshurama, who summoned rain through a Yajna conducted by sage Agastiya during a severe drought. During this ritual, a demon named Asurakumbha disrupted the proceedings, until Bheema intervened and eliminated the threat with a sword bestowed by Lord Ganesha.<br>
      
      The second legend revolves around the Allupas Dynasty, which ruled portions of coastal Karnataka from 450-1400 C.E. Initially sovereign, they later became vassals to several dominant dynasties, including the Kadambas and the Vijaynagara Rayas. According to local lore, a king from this dynasty, seeking to fend off an attack, enlisted the aid of a sage from Jambur. In response, Lord Shiva dispatched his forces, led by Nandi, to vanquish the invaders, after which the grateful king erected the temple to honor Shivaâ€™s army.<br>
